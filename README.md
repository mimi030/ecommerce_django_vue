# E-commerce Web Project (Django and Vue)

## About This E-commerce Web Project

This project is dedicated to creating a basic e-commerce website, encompassing essential features such as user registration, authentication, shopping cart management, and secure checkout. Developed with Django for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database, the project is containerized using Docker for seamless deployment.

### Key Features:

**User Authentication:** Enable users to register, log in, and log out securely.
**Shopping Cart Management:** Facilitate easy browsing and purchasing of products.
**Secure Checkout:** Implement a seamless and secure payment experience through integration with the Stripe API.
**API Integration:** Utilize Axios and Django Rest Framework for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
**Unit Testing:** Ensure the reliability and functionality of the API through comprehensive unit tests.
**Development Deployment:** Incorporate development and deployment best practices for efficient project management.

This project serves as an excellent foundation for building a scalable and robust e-commerce platform, providing essential functionalities and deployment features.

**Future Plans:**
In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of this e-commerce platform by adding advanced features such as registration confirmation, user reviews, and more. Additionally, I intend to optimize the project for production deployment by containerizing it with Docker and deploying it to cloud platforms for scalability and reliability.
